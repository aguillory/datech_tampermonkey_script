## About this script

 This script was made to help me sort projects in my preferred order: pay-per-task first, then starred, then by price, with projects that have less than 10 tasks remaining at the bottom. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script is a user-made creation designed to provide custom sorting to the DataAnnotation.tech projects tabl. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by DataAnnotation or any other official entity.
